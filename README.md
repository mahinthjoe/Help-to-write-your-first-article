## 🏋️‍♂️ Motivation
I think this is the most difficult part.

Because you might think that "Why should I write an article on that topic, there are tons of them out there."

Just dont care about that! 

As with coding, the important part is getting started!

Think of it as something you need to do! To be honest, you MUST do it if you want to improve yourself!
___

## 💡 Chose the topic
I suggest that you choose a topic in which you are very confident, something you may have used multiple times in your programming career.

For me, since I like programming in Unity3D, it was an article about the event system, that I personally use to create my Unity3D apps. 

https://medium.com/@francescociullaroma/simple-event-system-for-unity-3d-8fe24ed7c7ce 

It is still available only on medium medium and I will soon make a version for Dev.to.

If you have no topics you are confident, simply write down what you are studying right now. It could be useful to someone who hasn't started yet, and she/he know less about you on that subject!

## 🇲🇩  Markdown 

I suggest that you learn the basics of markdown. 

You don't have to be a Markdown Guru to start!

To start: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

More detailed: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown

You can use an IDE of course, i like VScode because it has this write/preview feature and you can see the result of the article while you are writing it!

An important thing: You can embed you code with this syntax:

![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9urqh97xfg8h97oirjnl.png)

Result
```javascript
const a = "Hello World"
```

## ✏️ Write the article

This is where you create your little, basic article.

It doesn't have to be long, is your first one and probably nobody is gonna read it 😅, even if it is good, just because so few people know that you can write a good article. Try to make one article every 2 days and you will see the difference

Think like you're writing some notes for yourself in the future.
___

## ✅ Check it!

This part is where I am still very lacking. 

You wrote the article and are so excited to share it with the world that you don't want to read it all over again, because you're lazy like me.

You should do it, you could ve surprised by the number of typos (I do a lot!)
___

## 🌇 Chose a nice cover picture

The content could be the best, but it is important to choose a good image, you can use for example:

https://unsplash.com/

You can add a cover picture by clicking this, on the top-right corner:

![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3799uxvmnd61h0sadh7x.png)

Important! Remember that the images may still be under copyright, even if they are on that site or on any! For example, I try to avoid using movie or Disney characters
___

## 🙌 Publish and Post it!

You can publish the article, dont worry you can always edit it later!

Now the fun part => Post it on Twitter! 

From Dev.to it's pretty simple! Click on the Twitter icon, add some tags and click that button!

Dont be afraid to do that, you can congratulate yourself now!
